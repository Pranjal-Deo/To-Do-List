#Simple To-Do List with Vanilla JavaScript


Description
This project involves creating a straightforward to-do list application using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The goal is to build a minimalistic and functional task management tool that allows users to add, edit, and remove tasks. This exercise is ideal for those looking to practice fundamental JavaScript concepts and gain experience in managing user interactions and DOM manipulation without relying on external libraries or frameworks.

Features:
Add Task: Users can input a new task into a text field and add it to the list by clicking an "Add" button.
Edit Task: Users can modify existing tasks by clicking an "Edit" button next to each task.
Remove Task: Users can delete tasks from the list by clicking a "Delete" button.
Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed, visually distinguishing them from incomplete tasks.
Persist Data: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
Technologies Used:
HTML: For the structure and layout of the to-do list.
CSS: For styling the application and ensuring a clean and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: For handling the application logic, including adding, editing, and deleting tasks, as well as managing local storage.
